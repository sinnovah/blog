# Linting

To run the linter, ensure you are in the virtual environment, and run the following terminal command: `flake8`

The remote CI/CD pipeline will automatically run the linter on every push to the main branch. So, it is highly recommended to run the linter locally before pushing to the main branch.

Information on how to write clean code can be found in the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#intermezzo-coding-style).
