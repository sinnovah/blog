## Unit testing

To run the unit tests, run the following terminal command: `python -m unittest discover tests`

The remote CI/CD pipeline will automatically run the unit tests on every push to the main branch. So, it is highly recommended to run the unit tests locally before pushing to the main branch.

Information on how to write unit tests can be found in the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
